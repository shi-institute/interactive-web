<script lang="ts">
  import * as Plot from '@observablehq/plot';

  // generate sample quantile data
  const data = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10];

## What is a quantile?

Quantiles are evenly-divided ranges of values from a broader range of data.
Each quantile has the same width (e.g., 0-10, 10-20, â€¦, 90-100), but each quantile
may have a different amount of values that fit in the quantile for the given dataset.

<PlotContainer plot={{
    marks: [
        Plot.barY(data, { x: d => `${d * 10 - 10}-${d * 10}`, y: 1, fill: "steelBlue" })
    ],
    x: { label: "Quantiles" },
    y: { label: "Count" },
    height: 150,
  }}
  fullWidth

## The two datasets

We separately compare urban and rural ZCTAs within their respective South Carolina regions:
Lowcountry, Midlands, Pee Dee, and Upstate. For each region, we calculate weighted ranks
for the urban ZCTAs and weighted ranks for the rural ZCTAs. We convert these into
quantiles on a 0-100 scale.

<aside class="note">
  Quantiles with a range of 0 to 100 are often called <i>percentiles</i>.

We show the difference between the housing value quantile and the income quantile.
An area of interest that is not gentrifying should have a similar rank/quantile
for housing value and income. Read more about this at https://doi.org/10.1177/00420980231173846.

<aside class="note">
  On our web tool, you may see an attribute or setting called <i>threshold</i>.
  This is the same as the <i>quantile difference</i>.
