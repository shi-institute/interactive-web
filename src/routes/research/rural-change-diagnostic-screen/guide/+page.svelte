    <h4>Showing and hiding layers</h4>
    <p>
      To show or hide layers, click the
      <calcite-icon aria-hidden="true" icon="layers" scale="s"></calcite-icon>
      Layers icon or button to open the
      <b>Layers pane.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Layers pane will show all available layers. Click the checkbox next to a layer to show or
      hide it on the map.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some layers are in groups. Click the arrow next to a group to expand or collapse the group.
      Groups and layers can be independently shown or hidden. If you try to show a layer in a group
      that is hidden, the layer will remain hidden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Layers and groups can be reordered by dragging and dropping them in the Layers pane. The order
      of layers and groups in the Layers pane determines the order in which they are drawn on the
      map. Layers and groups at the top of the list will be drawn on top of layers and groups at the
      bottom of the list.
